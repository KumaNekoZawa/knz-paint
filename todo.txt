all FIXMEs
all TODOs


color picker window
    show primary color and hsb/rgb/a
    show secondary color and hsb/rgb/a
    values should be textfields (editable, as hex)
    vertical colored sliders for rgbhsba (these will adaptively change colors)
transparency support
    new should either use black,white,transparent,a specific color,primary color or secondary color
    clear selection could use transparent
    any tool that uses setrgb might need to be adjusted to use drawline or smth
    any tool that does not use setrgb should already work


consistent usage of various tools
* Use keyboard keys !? or double click & right click !?
    'A': Apply (polygon will be applied to image and the operation is done)
    'C': Cancel (cancel operation and nothing will be applied)
