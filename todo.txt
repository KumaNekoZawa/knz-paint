all FIXMEs/TODOs

redraw icons to match the style from 90s Paint/Photoshop/etc. but still be self-drawn and usable

Refactor: MainPanel should not know about MainWindow (and maybe move all Options from MainPanel into some .model. package)

transparency support
    clear selection could use transparent
    any tool that uses setrgb might need to be adjusted to use drawline or smth
    any tool that does not use setrgb should already work

consistent usage of various tools
* Use keyboard keys !? or double click & right click !?
    'A': Apply (polygon will be applied to image and the operation is done)
    'C': Cancel (cancel operation and nothing will be applied)

selection tools
    move selection
brush tool
    with brush heads/sizes
    dashing etc
rounded rectangle tool
    many options

create palette from image feature

history feature
    stored as plain text
    can be saved/loaded
    can implement back/restore
    can be shown in a history view
    every tool has two methods: parseStr, formatStr
    some menu points need entries too
    new/open reset the history
    history tree!?

merge with all other paint and viewer software I've written in the past!
    (but make uconvert a separate cli program written in C/C++)

look at other programs
    paint
    irfanview
    photoshop
    coreldraw
    gimp
    pinta
